To play, use the left and right arrow keys or the A and D keys to move the paddle. If you press the up arrow or the W key, the ball will launch in a random direction. The goal is to break all the blocks by bouncing the ball against them without letting it touch the ground, and preventing the ball to fall to the ground as well. 

Each time you destroy a block, you earn a point, and some will drop power-ups that increase the ball's speed when caught with the paddle. If the power-up hits the ground then it will dissapear. If the ball falls, you lose a life, and if you lose all your lives, the game is over. Win by breaking all the blocks before running out of lives ðŸ˜Ž.
